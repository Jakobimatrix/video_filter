Header only library. Requires c++17:
From the Eigen Library: [https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/group__TopicStlContainers.html](Eigen and stl container)
"If you're compiling in [c++17] mode only with a sufficiently recent compiler (e.g., GCC>=7, clang>=5, MSVC>=19.12), then everything is taken care by the compiler..."

Might contain video Filter that I did not find in my free video editor. This is highly experimental and might explode upon usage.
 - light trail: select a light spot: The video output will show the light trail of that moving light spot like a long exposure.


Please use clang-tidy if you want to contribute: [easy installation](https://github.com/Jakobimatrix/initRepro)
